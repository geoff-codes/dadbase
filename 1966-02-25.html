              The songs formerly listed with this show are actually from a later date and have been moved to "07-??-66 unknown location" (David Lemieux claims this as part of 03-12-66 along with part of 05-19-66, which is what appears in DeadLists). According to DeadLists, Bear identifies this night as the �Sunset Acid Test.�
