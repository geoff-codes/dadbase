<tr class="notes"><td>Billing: Butterfield Blues Band; Jefferson Airplane; GD. The exact venue of these performances has been the subject of debate since we changed their location. Yes, they were scheduled for Winterland (which, contrary to Terry Doherty’s statement in the Internet Archive, did exist as a concert venue by this time) as listed on the poster, but Ralph Gleason’s column in the San Francisco Chronicle the morning of October 7 mentioned these shows as taking place at the Fillmore. On the same page, the Chronicle’s “Datebook” lists this billing as “opening today” at Fillmore Auditorium and specifically states that the shows were “switched from Winterland.” The week before, Bill Graham had moved the Butterfield-Airplane-Muddy Waters shows at Winterland to the Fillmore to prove that he wouldn’t back down to racial unrest in the surrounding neighborhood.  </i></td></tr>
