David Lemieux has provided the following that is posted for this date on DeadLists:Cream Puff War, Teddy Bear's Picnic, Sitting On Top Of The World, Minglewood, Cold Rain and Snow, Tastebud, Silver Threads, Baby Blue, Good Lovin', You Don't Have To Ask, On The Road Again, Next Time You See Me, I Know You Rider, Hey Little One, King Bee >Caution, Stealin' However-Cream Puff War through You Don�t Have to Ask are in the same order as on the 05-19-66 Avalon tape (when Lemieux posted this Good Lovin� online, it was the exact same version that circulates as 05-19), and the rest of it (which we previously dated as 02-25-66), sounds like it�s from much later, probably July. Most sources, because of Lemieux�s list, have moved the above set to the Pico Acid Test on 03-19, but it sounds like a regular gig rather than an Acid Test.
