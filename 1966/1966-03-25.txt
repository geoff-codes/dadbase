List incomplete. Above spelling of venue name is from the newspaper ad for this gig. An announcement made by Phil at this show has prompted DeadLists to add dates for an unknown location, or locations, on April 6 through 9. Philï¿½s commentary is cut before he announces what is actually happening on those dates, and even if he was announcing upcoming shows there is no further evidence that they were actually played.
