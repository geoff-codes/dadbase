7/15/1966 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA
One Kind Favor, Keep Rolling By*
Billing: Jefferson Airplane; GD. *ends set. These tunes appear on Birth of the Dead. Their date is uncertain but is likely since the Jefferson Airplane performed afterwards, neither tune is included in the 7/16 and 7/17 tapes, and Bear was no longer recording by the time of the two bandsï¿½ next joint billing.
