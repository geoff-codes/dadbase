Alice D. Millionaire
First ''Alice D. Millionaire''
"Love Pageant Rally" - LSD rally. Since there seems to be some question about whether the Dead actually played this event, we will point out that a Gene Anthony photo of the band playing here appears in both of his books and is identified as such in the firstï¿½"The Summer of Love."
