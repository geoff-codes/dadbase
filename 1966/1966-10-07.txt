10/7/1966 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA
Billing: Butterfield Blues Band; Jefferson Airplane; GD. The exact venue of these performances has been the subject of debate since we changed their location. Yes, they were scheduled for Winterland (which, contrary to Terry Doherty�s statement in the Internet Archive, did exist as a concert venue by this time) as listed on the poster, but Ralph Gleason�s column in the San Francisco Chronicle the morning of October 7 mentioned these shows as taking place at the Fillmore. On the same page, the Chronicle�s �Datebook� lists this billing as �opening today� at Fillmore Auditorium and specifically states that the shows were �switched from Winterland.� The week before, Bill Graham had moved the Butterfield-Airplane-Muddy Waters shows at Winterland to the Fillmore to prove that he wouldn�t back down to racial unrest in the surrounding neighborhood.
