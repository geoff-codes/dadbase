Saturday, November 5, 1966

11/5/1966 Avalon Ballroom, San Francisco, CA
Also: The Oxford Circle. The handbill for this weekend lists the dates for the shows as November 3 and 4, while the poster shows them correctly as the 4th and 5th. The Family Dog shows at the Avalon customarily took place on Friday and Saturday nights at this time. Apparently Mouse and Kelley made a mistake on the poster artwork (just as they did on the Daily Flash-Country Joe & the Fish poster two weeks earlier), and the handbills were printed before this was corrected.
