Tastebud, Mindbender, BIODTL
DeadLists states that, according to Bear, the Northridge Acid Test took place on Saturday February 19th, and that he �formally� met the Dead at the Fillmore gig on February 11th. We are throwing this out as a possibility without any further evidence.


2/10/1966 The Cabale, Berkeley, CA


2/11/1966 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA
Again, Bear claimed to have "formally" met the Dead at this gig, but there is no further evidence that it actually took place.

First ''Cold Rain''; First ''Hey Little One''; First ''I Know You Rider''; First ''Next Time''; First ''Stealin''; Next ''On The Road Again'' 12/1/1966 [75 shows]
The songs formerly listed with this show are actually from a later date and have been moved to "07-??-66 unknown location" (David Lemieux claims this as part of 03-12-66 along with part of 05-19-66, which is what appears in DeadLists). According to DeadLists, Bear identifies this night as the �Sunset Acid Test.�


2/vv/1966 (unknown), (unknown), CA

First ''BIODTL''; First ''One Kind Favor''; First ''Viola Lee Blues''; Only ''You See A Broken Heart''; Next ''Death Don't'' 12/1/1966 [73 shows]
David Lemieux has provided the following that is posted for this date on DeadLists:Cream Puff War, Teddy Bear's Picnic, Sitting On Top Of The World, Minglewood, Cold Rain and Snow, Tastebud, Silver Threads, Baby Blue, Good Lovin', You Don't Have To Ask, On The Road Again, Next Time You See Me, I Know You Rider, Hey Little One, King Bee >Caution, Stealin' However-Cream Puff War through You Don�t Have to Ask are in the same order as on the 05-19-66 Avalon tape (when Lemieux posted this Good Lovin� online, it was the exact same version that circulates as 05-19), and the rest of it (which we previously dated as 02-25-66), sounds like it�s from much later, probably July. Most sources, because of Lemieux�s list, have moved the above set to the Pico Acid Test on 03-19, but it sounds like a regular gig rather than an Acid Test.


3/19/1966 Carthay Studios, Los Angeles, CA

List incomplete. Above spelling of venue name is from the newspaper ad for this gig. An announcement made by Phil at this show has prompted DeadLists to add dates for an unknown location, or locations, on April 6 through 9. Phil�s commentary is cut before he announces what is actually happening on those dates, and even if he was announcing upcoming shows there is no further evidence that they were actually played.

10/7/1966 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA
Billing: Butterfield Blues Band; Jefferson Airplane; GD. The exact venue of these performances has been the subject of debate since we changed their location. Yes, they were scheduled for Winterland (which, contrary to Terry Doherty�s statement in the Internet Archive, did exist as a concert venue by this time) as listed on the poster, but Ralph Gleason�s column in the San Francisco Chronicle the morning of October 7 mentioned these shows as taking place at the Fillmore. On the same page, the Chronicle�s �Datebook� lists this billing as �opening today� at Fillmore Auditorium and specifically states that the shows were �switched from Winterland.� The week before, Bill Graham had moved the Butterfield-Airplane-Muddy Waters shows at Winterland to the Fillmore to prove that he wouldn�t back down to racial unrest in the surrounding neighborhood.

The Family Dog shows at the Avalon customarily took place on Friday and Saturday nights at this time. Apparently Mouse and Kelley made a mistake on the poster artwork (just as they did on the Daily Flash-Country Joe & the Fish poster two weeks earlier), and the handbills were printed before this was corrected.
