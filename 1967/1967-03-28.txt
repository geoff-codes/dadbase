Tuesday, March 28, 1967

3/28/1967 The Rock Garden, San Francisco, CA
Also: The Charles Lloyd Quartet; The Mystery Trend. There is some confusion in DeadLists as to which year these gigs took place, based in part on the fact that the dates on the poster were changed and no days of the week were listed. It is common knowledge in poster collecting circles that this venue was in operation during the spring of 1967 and that its distinctive diamond-shaped posters were designed by Mike Wood in a style similar to those he did subsequently for various promoters at California Hall. Wood was not active in the poster designing field before this. For definitive proof, though, we turn to the San Francisco Chronicle, whose �Datebook� listing for March 28, 1967 had the Dead, Charles Lloyd, and the Mystery Trend opening at the Rock Garden that night. Ralph Gleason mentioned the show in his next day�s column, and the �Datebook� for Sunday April 2 had this bill as closing that night.
