5/11/1967 Marigold Ballroom, Fresno, CA
The Lost Live Dead blog lists this as Friday the 12th, citing a review in the May 13 Fresno Bee. However, nowhere does the reviewer state that the show took place the night before. The blog claims two shows starting at 9:45 and 11:15 along with an opening band called the Road Runners, but does not cite a source for this information.
