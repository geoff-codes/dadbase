6/18/1967 Monterey Fairgrounds, Monterey, CA
Viola Lee Blues, Cold Rain, Alligator > Caution
Monterey International Pop Festival - also: The Blues Project; Big Brother and The Holding Co.; The Byrds; The Band With No Name; Buffalo Springfield with David Crosby, without Neil Young; The Who; Jimi Hendrix; The Mama's and The Papa's; Otis Redding; Canned Heat. Speculation exists as to whether or not Alligator and Caution are from another performance, based primarily on the fact that Bill Graham tells the audience to give the band a hand afterwards. Graham was in attendance and there was no reason for him not to have done that, especially since various other luminaries announced the acts during the course of the festival. The most convincing evidence, however, is that the same unidentified person playing harmonica badly during Alligator is also audible on Cold Rain and Snow. Alligator is described in DeadLists as a primitive version without vocals, but Jerry�s, Bob�s, and Phil�s backing vocals come through loud and clear with Pig Pen barely audible in the background; it seems that
his microphone was not working during this tune.
