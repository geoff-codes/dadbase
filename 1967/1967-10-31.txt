10/31/1967 Winterland Arena, San Francisco, CA
Viola Lee Blues, Cold Rain, Alligator > Caution
"Trip or Freak." Also: QMS; Big Brother and The Holding Co. This audience recording has circulated for years as 1-27 or 1-28-67, but we previously moved it to 9-4-67 since the presence of Alligator>Caution argued for a later date. However, the Morning Dew and New Potato Caboose that precede Viola Lee Blues on this tape match exactly those on the soundboard recording of 10-22-67, but Cold Rain and Snow does not. It was not unknown in those days for tapers to record one or two songs at one gig, then come back the next night or the next week and record more tunes on the same tape. 10-31 was the Deadï¿½s next gig after 10-22. Plus, two drummers are very much in evidence on this recording but the drum duet is quite brief and occurs during the Alligator jam rather than before it, which would place this recording before the November Shrine shows. The 10-31-67 date, though, should not be taken as definitive.
