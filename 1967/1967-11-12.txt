Benefit for the Bands. The above circulates as part of a studio sessions tape dated 10-20-67, but only Turn on Your Lovelight from that source is an actual studio recording. This material sounds like a live performance plagued with defective vocal mics (although Garciaï¿½s seems to work sporadically), and seems very close in time to the November Shrine shows, hence the 11-12-67 date. But this should not be taken as definitive.
