Also: QMS; Johnny Hammond and His Screaming Nighthawks; Robert Baker.


3/28/1967 The Rock Garden, San Francisco, CA
Also: The Charles Lloyd Quartet; The Mystery Trend. There is some confusion in DeadLists as to which year these gigs took place, based in part on the fact that the dates on the poster were changed and no days of the week were listed. It is common knowledge in poster collecting circles that this venue was in operation during the spring of 1967 and that its distinctive diamond-shaped posters were designed by Mike Wood in a style similar to those he did subsequently for various promoters at California Hall. Wood was not active in the poster designing field before this. For definitive proof, though, we turn to the San Francisco Chronicle, whose �Datebook� listing for March 28, 1967 had the Dead, Charles Lloyd, and the Mystery Trend opening at the Rock Garden that night. Ralph Gleason mentioned the show in his next day�s column, and the �Datebook� for Sunday April 2 had this bill as closing that night.

6/18/1967 Monterey Fairgrounds, Monterey, CA
Viola Lee Blues, Cold Rain, Alligator > Caution
Monterey International Pop Festival - also: The Blues Project; Big Brother and The Holding Co.; The Byrds; The Band With No Name; Buffalo Springfield with David Crosby, without Neil Young; The Who; Jimi Hendrix; The Mama's and The Papa's; Otis Redding; Canned Heat. Speculation exists as to whether or not Alligator and Caution are from another performance, based primarily on the fact that Bill Graham tells the audience to give the band a hand afterwards. Graham was in attendance and there was no reason for him not to have done that, especially since various other luminaries announced the acts during the course of the festival. The most convincing evidence, however, is that the same unidentified person playing harmonica badly during Alligator is also audible on Cold Rain and Snow. Alligator is described in DeadLists as a primitive version without vocals, but Jerry�s, Bob�s, and Phil�s backing vocals come through loud and clear with Pig Pen barely audible in the background; it seems that
his microphone was not working during this tune.

Marijuana Defense benefit. Also: QMS; Big Brother and The Holding Co. An audience recording of the Morning Dew and New Potato Caboose long circulated as part of a tape dated 1-27 or 1-28-67.


10/31/1967 Winterland Arena, San Francisco, CA
Viola Lee Blues, Cold Rain, Alligator > Caution
"Trip or Freak." Also: QMS; Big Brother and The Holding Co. This audience recording has circulated for years as 1-27 or 1-28-67, but we previously moved it to 9-4-67 since the presence of Alligator>Caution argued for a later date. However, the Morning Dew and New Potato Caboose that precede Viola Lee Blues on this tape match exactly those on the soundboard recording of 10-22-67, but Cold Rain and Snow does not. It was not unknown in those days for tapers to record one or two songs at one gig, then come back the next night or the next week and record more tunes on the same tape. 10-31 was the Dead�s next gig after 10-22. Plus, two drummers are very much in evidence on this recording but the drum duet is quite brief and occurs during the Alligator jam rather than before it, which would place this recording before the November Shrine shows. The 10-31-67 date, though, should not be taken as definitive.


11/10/1967 Shrine Exhibition Hall, Los Angeles, CA

The Dead did not play on 11-08-67 or 11-09-67, despite the fact that parts of this show and the next night have been misdated as such in the past.

Alligator > Drums > Alligator > Caution, Cryptical > Other One > Cryptical
Benefit for the Bands. The above circulates as part of a studio sessions tape dated 10-20-67, but only Turn on Your Lovelight from that source is an actual studio recording. This material sounds like a live performance plagued with defective vocal mics (although Garcia�s seems to work sporadically), and seems very close in time to the November Shrine shows, hence the 11-12-67 date. But this should not be taken as definitive.
