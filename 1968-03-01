<tr class="notes"><td>Also: Looking Glass. Since some confusion still exists about these gigs, clarification is necessary. The eyewitness who reported this at first mistakenly identified the venue as “The Looking Glass,” but then realized it was the name of the band that opened for the Dead (or perhaps he was initially misunderstood). The venue’s address was 1300 Boulevard Way in Walnut Creek, with the name still unknown. But these shows definitely took place.</i></td></tr>
