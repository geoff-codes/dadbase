3/1/1968 1300 Boulevard Way, Walnut Creek, CA
Also: Looking Glass. Since some confusion still exists about these gigs, clarification is necessary. The eyewitness who reported this at first mistakenly identified the venue as �The Looking Glass,� but then realized it was the name of the band that opened for the Dead (or perhaps he was initially misunderstood). The venue�s address was 1300 Boulevard Way in Walnut Creek, with the name still unknown. But these shows definitely took place.
