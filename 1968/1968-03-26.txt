3/26/1968 MelodyLand Theater , Anaheim, CA
Previous ''Top Of The World'' 7/30/1966 [204 shows]
The MelodyLand shows actually took place on 3-8 and 9-68. The tape long dated 03-26-68 and identified as �MelodyLand Theatre� or �unknown location� is, judging by Dick Latvala�s notes, actually the first part of 03-29-68. This misread tape is the only evidence of a gig on 03-26.; Phil Lesh's 250th Show


First Played Last Played Played (ttl.) Played ('68) Every Time Played
