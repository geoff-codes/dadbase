Saturday, March 30, 1968

3/30/1968 Carousel Ballroom, San Francisco, CA
Morning Dew, Cryptical > Other One > Cryptical > Dark Star > China Cat > The Eleven > Turn On Your Lovelight, Born Cross-Eyed > Spanish Jam > Death Don�t
Next ''Dancin'' 5/7/1969 [146 shows]
Also: Chuck Berry; Curly Cook's Hurdy-Gurdy Band. Judging by Dick Latvala�s notes, the songs after Death Don�t Have No Mercy long included on taped with this date actually opened the following night, and a sonic comparison confirms this. DeadLists has a set break after Lovelight, but no such announcement can be heard on this recording. Evidence points toward the Dead having played only one set each night during this run.
