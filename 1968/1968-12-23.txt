Only ''The One You Love''
Mickey Hart And The Hartbeats. First set blues jam with Jack Casady, Spencer Dryden. Second set with Jack Casady, David Getz. Third set with Harvey Mandel, George Chambers. The circulating recording labeled as the Hartbeats from this month contains the tunes �The Creator Has a Master Plan,� and �Hartbeat Blues� into �Last jam.� Where this fits into the above is uncertain; one school of thought places the three tunes during the following night when Garcia supposedly jammed with the Harvey Mandel Band. In fact, where the above tunes actually belong is a mystery as well.
