II: BIODTL, Morning Dew, Cryptical > Other One > Cryptical > Schoolgirl
First ''Born Cross-Eyed''; First ''China Cat''; First ''The Eleven''
"Ben Franklin's Birthday." Also: QMS.


1/20/1968 Eureka Municipal Auditorium, Eureka, CA
Viola Lee Blues *, Schoolgirl **, Clementine > New Potato Caboose > Born Cross-Eyed > Feedback > Spanish Jam > Caution > Dark Star
First ''Clementine''
"The Quick and The Dead" tour of the Great Pacific Northwest begins. Also: QMS. * appears on "Road Trips Vol. 2 No. 2" ** appears on the "Road Trips Vol. 2 No. 2" bonus disc. Both tunes might have been played elsewhere in the set.


1/22/1968 Eagles Auditorium, Seattle, WA
Evidence suggests that the Dead played the Eagles Auditorium on the 26th and 27th rather than the 22nd and 23rd.


1/26/1968 Eagles Auditorium, Seattle, WA
Alligator > Drums > Alligator, Cryptical > Other One > Cryptical > New Potato Caboose > Born Cross-Eyed > Feedback > Spanish Jam > Dark Star > China Cat > The Eleven > Caution > Feedback
Also: QMS. Above is from a vault tape labeled Seattle and dated 1-22-68. However, contemporary Seattle newspaper ads only mention shows on the 26th and 27th, as does the poster. In addition, the Anthem of the Sun source dates for its live material only list Seattle shows for the 26th and 27th and not the 22nd and 23rd. The We Bid You Goodnight formerly listed here (that often circulates with this show) actually belongs to 03-31-68. The circulating tape of this show cuts in the middle of Caution.


1/27/1968 Eagles Auditorium, Seattle, WA
Viola Lee Blues **, BIODTL *, Hurts Me Too *, Cryptical > Other One > Cryptical > Clementine > New Potato Caboose > Born Cross-Eyed > Spanish Jam, Dark Star ** > China Cat ** > The Eleven ** > Turn On Your Lovelight **
Also: QMS. * appears on "Road Trips Vol. 2 No. 2." ** appears on the "Road Trips Vol. 2 No. 2" bonus disc. This material might have been performed elsewhere in the set. The above is from a vault tape labeled Seattle and dated 1-23-68. However, contemporary Seattle newspaper ads only mention shows on the 26th and 27th, as does the poster. In addition, the Anthem of the Sun source dates for its live material only list Seattle shows for the 26th and 27th and not the 22nd and 23rd. Also, the Spanish jam is cut in the middle-the second half comes from a circulating fragment dated 1-27-68 that could be a continuation of the first half, albeit from a different generational source.


1/29/1968 Portland State College, Portland, OR
Also: QMS; PH Phactor Jug Band.


1/30/1968 Erb Memorial Union, U. of Oregon, Eugene, OR

2/17/1968 Selland Arena, Fresno, CA

Also: Morning Glory. Entire set appears on "Dick�s Picks Vol. 22."


3/1/1968 1300 Boulevard Way, Walnut Creek, CA
Also: Looking Glass. Since some confusion still exists about these gigs, clarification is necessary. The eyewitness who reported this at first mistakenly identified the venue as �The Looking Glass,� but then realized it was the name of the band that opened for the Dead (or perhaps he was initially misunderstood). The venue�s address was 1300 Boulevard Way in Walnut Creek, with the name still unknown. But these shows definitely took place.


3/2/1968 1300 Boulevard Way, Walnut Creek, CA
Also: Looking Glass.


3/3/1968 Haight Street, San Francisco, CA
Viola Lee Blues, Smokestack, Lovelight, Hurts Me Too, Cryptical > Other One > Cryptical, Dancin
Next ''Smokestack'' 5/7/1969 [157 shows]
Afternoon concert. List incomplete - batteries were running down so the taper, Steve Brown, only recorded certain songs. The set-closing "Dancin" comes from an eyewitness. Pieces of indeterminate 1969 shows have circulated under this date in the past-any recording with this date containing different songs than listed above is erroneous.


3/7/1968 San Quentin State Prison, San Quentin, CA
This performance actually took place on 2-15-68. The recording now correctly identified as 10-12-68 has been misidentified as this show in the past.


3/8/1968 MelodyLand Theater , Anaheim, CA
Also: Jefferson Airplane. The Dead played this venue on March 8 and 9 and not on the 26th.


3/9/1968 MelodyLand Theater , Anaheim, CA
Early show. Also: Jefferson Airplane. The Dead played this venue on March 8 and 9 and not on the 26th.

I: Dark Star * > China Cat * > The Eleven * > Schoolgirl
II: Morning Dew, Hurts Me Too, Cryptical > Other One > Cryptical, Alligator > Drums > Alligator > Caution > Feedback > We Bid You Goodnight
First ''We Bid You Goodnight''; Next ''Hurts Me Too'' 12/7/1968 [87 shows]
Also: Jefferson Airplane. Appears on "So Many Roads (1965-1995)." DeadLists has Morning Dew as the encore, which is incorrect.


3/17/1968 Carousel Ballroom, San Francisco, CA
I: Dark Star > Born Cross-Eyed, Lovelight
II: Cryptical > Other One > Cryptical > New Potato Caboose > China Cat > The Eleven > Caution > Feedback
Also: Jefferson Airplane. Reel 2 of this show (Lovelight onwards) was released as "Grateful Dead Download Series Vol. 6." Reel 1 is no longer playable due to experiments conducted upon it for "Anthem of the Sun."


3/18/1968 50 Green Street, San Francisco, CA
The Lost Live Dead blog reports that, according to Dennis McNally (and we can�t find the source for this), the Dead played outside the KMPX studios at 3AM. It is certain that Garcia and Hart sat in with Traffic, since photos of them doing so exist.


3/20/1968 Avalon Ballroom, San Francisco, CA
KMPX-FM Strike benefit.; The Grateful Dead's 250th Show; Jerry Garcia's 250th Show; Bob Weir's 250th Show; Bill Kreutzmann's 250th Show; Ron McKernan's 250th Show


3/22/1968 State Fair Coliseum, Detroit, MI
Also: Eric Burdon and The Animals; Eire Apparent; Apostles; Jagged Edge.


3/23/1968 Grande Ballroom, Detroit, MI
Also: Eric Burdon and The Animals; Eire Apparent; Apostles; Jagged Edge. According to the Lost Live Dead blog, this show was moved from the State Fair Coliseum in Detroit due to lack of ticket sales.


3/24/1968 Fountain Church, Grand Rapids, MI


3/26/1968 MelodyLand Theater , Anaheim, CA
Previous ''Top Of The World'' 7/30/1966 [204 shows]
The MelodyLand shows actually took place on 3-8 and 9-68. The tape long dated 03-26-68 and identified as �MelodyLand Theatre� or �unknown location� is, judging by Dick Latvala�s notes, actually the first part of 03-29-68. This misread tape is the only evidence of a gig on 03-26.; Phil Lesh's 250th Show


3/29/1968 Carousel Ballroom, San Francisco, CA
Schoolgirl, Death Don�t, Top of the World, Dark Star, Morning Dew, Lovelight > Cryptical > Other One > Cryptical > New Potato Caboose > Born Cross-Eyed
Also: Chuck Berry; Curly Cook's Hurdy-Gurdy Band. The first four tunes are from a tape long misidentified as 03-26-68, and judging by Dick Latvala�s notes actually form the first part of 03-29-68. A sonic comparison of both recordings confirms this


3/30/1968 Carousel Ballroom, San Francisco, CA
Morning Dew, Cryptical > Other One > Cryptical > Dark Star > China Cat > The Eleven > Turn On Your Lovelight, Born Cross-Eyed > Spanish Jam > Death Don�t
Next ''Dancin'' 5/7/1969 [146 shows]
Also: Chuck Berry; Curly Cook's Hurdy-Gurdy Band. Judging by Dick Latvala�s notes, the songs after Death Don�t Have No Mercy long included on taped with this date actually opened the following night, and a sonic comparison confirms this. DeadLists has a set break after Lovelight, but no such announcement can be heard on this recording. Evidence points toward the Dead having played only one set each night during this run.


3/31/1968 Carousel Ballroom, San Francisco, CA
Lovelight, BIODTL, Dancin, Caution > Feedback > We Bid You Goodnight
Also: Chuck Berry; Curly Cook's Hurdy-Gurdy Band. The first three tunes have long circulated as the end of 03-30-68, but Dick Latvala�s notes place them during 03-31 and a sonic comparison confirms this. We Bid You Goodnight often appears on the Seattle tape misdated as 1-22-68.


4/3/1968 Winterland Arena, San Francisco, CA
Cryptical > Other One > Cryptical > New Potato Caboose > Born Cross-Eyed, Alligator > Caution
Final ''Born Cross-Eyed''
KMPX-FM Strike benefit. Also: Moby Grape; Electric Flag; The Youngbloods; Mother Earth; It's A Beautiful Day. List, from an eyewitness, may be incomplete and out of order. One of the undated June 1968 Carousel Ballroom tapes sometimes circulates under this date, but no substantive proof exists to support this.


4/7/1968 , ,
No Grateful Dead performance is known to have taken place on this date. The recording now correctly identified as 10-12-68 has been misdated as such.

6/1/1968 Panhandle, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, CA
According to the Lost Live Dead blog, the Dead, Charlie Musselwhite, and Petris, who were all playing the Carousel Ballroom that weekend, did a free gig in the Panhandle the afternoon of the last show. The blog has not yet cited specifically where it got this information, only that it has been �alluded to in various places.� It should be stated that bands were not generally known to be playing the Panhandle at this time.

Also: Lee Michaels; Linn County; Mance Lipscomb. Pig Pen did not perform. This show was not broadcast live on the radio at the time of its performance, but a recording of it aired on KSAN as part of a San Francisco Music anniversary celebration in early 1976 along with the 11-19-66 Cold Rain and Snow and a Morning Dew of earlier origin, which have thus sometimes been included as part of this show. This recording circulated for years primarily as 10-13-68 but also as 03-07-68, 04-07-68, 06-06-68, 08-23-68, 08-24-68, 10-22-68, and 06-07-69.

Also: Lee Michaels; Linn County; Mance Lipscomb. Pig Pen did not perform. This is the actual 10-13-68, and while the setlist is almost identical to that of the previous night it is in fact a different performance, and was not broadcast on the radio.

Doin� That Rag and Dupree�s, however, had not been performed live yet, which makes this information somewhat suspect.

*Garcia solo acoustic. Bill Kreutzmann was absent. DeadBase has received criticism online for not knowing the name of the first set opening tune in previous editions, which took the form of casting negative aspersions on our knowledge of the Grateful Dead. When we first got this list the recording of this show did not yet circulate, and our source was apparently not familiar with or did not recognize "Rosemary.'

Only ''The One You Love''
Mickey Hart And The Hartbeats. First set blues jam with Jack Casady, Spencer Dryden. Second set with Jack Casady, David Getz. Third set with Harvey Mandel, George Chambers. The circulating recording labeled as the Hartbeats from this month contains the tunes �The Creator Has a Master Plan,� and �Hartbeat Blues� into �Last jam.� Where this fits into the above is uncertain; one school of thought places the three tunes during the following night when Garcia supposedly jammed with the Harvey Mandel Band. In fact, where the above tunes actually belong is a mystery as well.
