              This was a NRPS gig rather than the Grateful Dead, according to that morning�s Ralph J. Gleason column in the San Francisco Chronicle. Gleason refers to the venue as the �S. J. State College Student Ballroom;� Lost Live Dead assumes he meant the same venue the Dead played on the 31st.
