"Frontiers of Science Celestial Synapse. " Also: Golden Toad. This very poor recording circulates as 06-19-68, which is erroneous. Apparently the date written on the vault tape�s box is unclear enough to where Dick read it as 08-29-68, meaning that it could easily be 02-19-69. More importantly, the Lovelight>Not Fade Away>Lovelight sandwich sounds very close in time to the "Live Dead" shows, and TC can occasionally be heard through the murk. The Lovelight>Not Fade Away>Lovelight ends the Dead�s regular set, after which Don McCoy of Rancho Olompali makes a speech. According to the San Francisco Chronicle review of the Celestial Synapse, he did that very thing at this show and, in common with many others in attendance, while not wearing any clothes. The group chanting, and the loose nature of the jam that followed also fit into the general description of the Celestial Synapse. This jam featured several guest musicians, but it�s difficult to ascertain who they are. The presence of both
Not Fade Away and The Main Ten also argue for the 02-19-69 date. Not Fade Away had not been performed at all in probably close to three years, but the next attempt at it took place in Boston on April 23rd. The Main Ten had never been played previously, but surfaced again at the Tucson show on April 11th. And, the Dead�s crew brought Pacific Recording�s 16-track machine to this gig in another attempt to record material for what eventually became "Live Dead." Obviously, the sound problems that occurred explain why none of it was used.
