Lovelight
"Memorial Day Ball." Also: Lee Michaels; The Youngbloods. Above is the one tune reported from this show by Michael Lydon in Rolling Stone. The recording that circulates under this date is actually from 05-11-69 in San Diego, since Lydon did not report a bunch of percussionists all on stage at once.
