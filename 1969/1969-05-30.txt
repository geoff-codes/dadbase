5/30/1969 Springer's Inn, Portland, OR
Morning Dew, Me and My Uncle, Doin That Rag, King Bee, Dark Star > Cosmic Charlie, St. Stephen > The Eleven > Lovelight
DeadLists states that the circulating tape of this show cuts after Garcia teasing the opening notes to St. Stephen and resumes right before the first vocals to The Eleven, therefore the actual presence of St. Stephen is uncertain. Our copy of this show, however, does contain the complete Stephen, which features an extended intro due to Garciaï¿½s having broken a string for about the third time that night.
