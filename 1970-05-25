This gig was long thought to have been scheduled for May 28 and canceled, based on the fact that Garcia's passport was stamped for re-entry in Los Angeles on the 26th. However, in his autobiography Mick Fleetwood mentions playing with the Dead at the Lyceum on the 25th, and that it was Peter Green's last gig before leaving Fleetwood Mac.   </i></td></tr>
