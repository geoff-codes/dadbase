5/21/1970 Euphoria Ballroom, San Rafael, CA
This show did not take place. DeadLists has the Dead playing this date at this venue with Big Brother and Janis, and with Janis sitting in with the Dead during Lovelight. They seem to be confusing it with the 07-16-70 Euphoria Ballroom show and with a Hell's Angels party at the same venue at which both Janis and her band and Big Brother played. The Euphoria Ballroom became Pepperland in September of 1970.
