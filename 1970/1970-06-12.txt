6/12/1970 Honolulu Civic Auditorium, Honolulu, HI
Cryptical > Drums > Other One > Cryptical
Also: QMS; NRPS. Setlist incomplete. Here we will also emphasize that John Cipollina and Dino Valenti must have been mistaken when they told Mike Dolgushkin that Quicksilver played with the Dead at a Honolulu club called the Red Vest and at Diamond Head Crater, but not at Honolulu Civic (DeadLists still claims the erroneous venues).
