Early show. Also: NRPS. This recording commonly circulates as the 03-20-70 early show, however, Howard Stein can be heard welcoming the band back to the Capitol Theater, which he would not have done at their first performance there. The recording long dated either 06-25-70 or the 06-24-70 early show is actually Marty Weinbergï¿½s master of 07-10-70 at the Fillmore East.
