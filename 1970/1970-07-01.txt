"Red River Exhibition," "Trans Continental Pop Festival." Also: NRPS. *appears as a Festival Express DVD bonus song. Setlist is likely incomplete. This is a good place to point out that the "Festival Express" movie and DVD includes footage of Garcia, Weir, Rick Danko, Janis, and others performing "No More Cane on the Brazos" aboard the train itself, and a recording exists of Garcia, Weir, and others performing four jams (one of which is barely recognizable as �Honky Tonk Women�) and an instrumental "Sugar Magnolia," likewise aboard the train.
