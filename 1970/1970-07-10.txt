Midnight show. Billing: GD; NRPS. This recording circulated for years as 6-25-70 at the Capitol Theater in Port Chester, New York, before being re-dated as the early show on the 06-24-70 after it became evident that no show took place at that venue on the 25th. This is actually legendary taper Marty Weinberg�s master of the 07-10-70 Fillmore East show (minus the acoustic set). Indeed, before the encore someone can be heard announcing right into the tape machine-�Yes, here we are at the scenic Fillmore Auditorium [sic] in the scenic East Village.� If this is not confusing enough, parts of 04-12-70 have circulated under this date.
