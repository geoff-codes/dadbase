First ''Rosalie McFall''; Only ''So Sad''
Midnight show. Billing: GD; NRPS. *with Weir on vocals. Only "So Sad." @acoustic. Several attendees of this show and the following have claimed that the performance long identified as 07-11-70 is actually 07-12, and vice-versa. While we will acknowledge this as a possibility, we will also point out that two audience master recordings (one of them Weinberg�s) exist of what has long been identified as 07-11, and both of them bear that date. Confusion may arise from the fact that these shows began at midnight: would one identify this as taking place the night of the 11th or the morning of the 12th?
