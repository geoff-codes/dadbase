Billing: GD; NRPS. *with David Nelson. Two journalists wrote on this performance: Michael Lydon in Rolling Stone, and Ed McLahahan in Playboy. While both left out a few songs, it�s clear that they are talking about this show. In addition, McLanahan mentioned Lovelight from the following night; it�s unfortunate that he was too zoned on nitrous oxide the night of the 17th to have given a report on it.
