Also: NRPS. Acoustic set with David Grisman and David Nelson on mandolin. "GDTRFB" jam during "NFA." @acoustic. The fragment of Good Lovinï¿½ sometimes included on this recording actually belongs with 09-18-70. This entire show has been rearranged and passed off as 09-25-70, has been misdated as 02-02-70, and the "NFA > Caution" has been tacked onto "The Other One" from 02-23-71 and dated 11-10-70. And if that's not enough, "Big Boy Pete" has circulated as being from the King's Beach Bowl shows in February 1968.
