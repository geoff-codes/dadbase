10/5/1970 Winterland Arena, San Francisco, CA
Casey Jones, Hard to Handle +, Candyman +, Me and My Uncle +, Good Lovin> Drums > Good Lovin, Dancin*+, Lovelight.
Also: Jefferson Airplane; QMS; Hot Tuna; NRPS. *appears (correctly dated) as a bonus track on "Grateful Dead Download Series: Family Dog at the Great Highway." +these tunes circulate incorrectly dated 12-23-70, since a compilation multitrack tape was made on that date consisting of material from this show and the one previous. The above list, except for the opening and closing songs, might have been performed in a different order, and there may be tunes missing. Deadlists claims two Dead sets on this night, but considering the number of bands on the bill it is highly unlikely.
