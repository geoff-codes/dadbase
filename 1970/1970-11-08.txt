II: Morning Dew, Me and My Uncle, Mystery Train > My Babe, Around, New Orleans > Searchin, Baby Blue, Casey Jones, Truckin > Dark Star > The Main Ten > Dancin, NFA > GDTRFB > NFA > Good Lovin > Drums > Good Lovin
First ''Around''; Only ''My Babe''; Only ''Mystery Train''; Next ''Searchin'' 4/27/1971 [57 shows]; Final ''Operator''; Final ''The Main Ten''; Final ''Wake Up Little Susie''
Also: NRPS. "Dark Star" is first verse only - only "My Babe" - only "Mystery Train". Since this show featured the Dead�s last acoustic set until 11-17-78, it seems a good place to point out that all subsequent NRPS and GD double bills had the New Riders performing before the Dead. Setlists on some websites have the New Riders' sets taking place between the Dead�s electric sets well into 1971, which is erroneous.
