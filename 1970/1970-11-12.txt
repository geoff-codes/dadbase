Next ''New Orleans'' 6/21/1984 [879 shows]
Also: NRPS. DeadBaseï¿½s long-running setlist of this show is from a tape that circulated in the 1970s but does not seem to be available now. It could well be from another show or combination of shows, but that is impossible to determine in the absence of this particular recording.
