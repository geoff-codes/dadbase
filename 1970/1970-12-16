              Billed as Jerry Garcia & Friends: David Crosby with Garcia, Lesh, and Hart. Soundcheck: Alabama Bound, Eight Miles High, Cowboy Movie, Wall Song, Bertha, Bird Song. The soundcheck had to have taken place no earlier than this date, since the band can be heard talking about what happened the night before. The live segment happened after the soundcheck, since Bertha sounds considerably more together. This is probably from the 16th but could have taken place the 17th, or the soundcheck could be from the 16th and the live segment from the 17th.
