According to the Lost Live Dead blog, the Dead may have actually played an off-campus event called the �Clam Jam.�


5/19/1970 Washington University, St. Louis, MO


5/21/1970 Euphoria Ballroom, San Rafael, CA
This show did not take place. DeadLists has the Dead playing this date at this venue with Big Brother and Janis, and with Janis sitting in with the Dead during Lovelight. They seem to be confusing it with the 07-16-70 Euphoria Ballroom show and with a Hell's Angels party at the same venue at which both Janis and her band and Big Brother played. The Euphoria Ballroom became Pepperland in September of 1970.

5/25/1970 The Strand Lyceum, London, England
Also: Fleetwood Mac. This gig was long thought to have been scheduled for May 28 and canceled, based on the fact that Garcia's passport was stamped for re-entry in Los Angeles on the 26th. However, in his autobiography Mick Fleetwood mentions playing with the Dead at the Lyceum on the 25th, and that it was Peter Green's last gig before leaving Fleetwood Mac.

The recording long dated either 06-25-70 or the 06-24-70 early show is actually Marty Weinberg�s master of 07-10-70 at the Fillmore East.

6/27/1970 Coronation Park, Toronto, Canada
The Dead played an acoustic set at this park to appease the ticketless hordes clamoring for free admission to the regular festival. Footage of this appears in the movie and DVD of "Festival Express" accompanied by the studio recording of "Friend of the Devil."

This is a good place to point out that the "Festival Express" movie and DVD includes footage of Garcia, Weir, Rick Danko, Janis, and others performing "No More Cane on the Brazos" aboard the train itself, and a recording exists of Garcia, Weir, and others performing four jams (one of which is barely recognizable as �Honky Tonk Women�) and an instrumental "Sugar Magnolia," likewise aboard the train.

Midnight show. Billing: GD; NRPS. This recording circulated for years as 6-25-70 at the Capitol Theater in Port Chester, New York, before being re-dated as the early show on the 06-24-70 after it became evident that no show took place at that venue on the 25th. This is actually legendary taper Marty Weinberg�s master of the 07-10-70 Fillmore East show (minus the acoustic set). Indeed, before the encore someone can be heard announcing right into the tape machine-�Yes, here we are at the scenic Fillmore Auditorium [sic] in the scenic East Village.� If this is not confusing enough, parts of 04-12-70 have circulated under this date.

While we will acknowledge this as a possibility, we will also point out that two audience master recordings (one of them Weinberg�s) exist of what has long been identified as 07-11, and both of them bear that date. Confusion may arise from the fact that these shows began at midnight: would one identify this as taking place the night of the 11th or the morning of the 12th?

II: Morning Dew, Me and My Uncle, Mystery Train > My Babe, Around, New Orleans > Searchin, Baby Blue, Casey Jones, Truckin > Dark Star > The Main Ten > Dancin, NFA > GDTRFB > NFA > Good Lovin > Drums > Good Lovin
First ''Around''; Only ''My Babe''; Only ''Mystery Train''; Next ''Searchin'' 4/27/1971 [57 shows]; Final ''Operator''; Final ''The Main Ten''; Final ''Wake Up Little Susie''
Also: NRPS. "Dark Star" is first verse only - only "My Babe" - only "Mystery Train". Since this show featured the Dead�s last acoustic set until 11-17-78, it seems a good place to point out that all subsequent NRPS and GD double bills had the New Riders performing before the Dead. Setlists on some websites have the New Riders' sets taking place between the Dead�s electric sets well into 1971, which is erroneous.


11/9/1970 Action House, Island Park, NY
Attics, Mama Tried, Walking The Dog, Minglewood, Morning Dew, Deep Elem
Next ''Walking The Dog'' 3/29/1984 [856 shows]
Also: NRPS. The circulating recording of 09-29-69 has often been misidentified as 11-09-70.


11/10/1970 Action House, Island Park, NY
The recording that circulates with this date is actually a combination of 09-20-70 and 02-23-71.


11/11/1970 46th Street Rock Palace, Brooklyn, NY
Casey Jones, Me and My Uncle, Cold Rain, China Cat > I Know You Rider, Big RxR Blues, Mama Tried, Hurts Me Too, Cryptical > Drums > Other One > Cryptical > Sugar Magnolia, Hard To Handle, Truckin, Good Lovin > Drums > Good Lovin, Cumberland, GDTRFB, John's Other*, Uncle Sam Blues*, Around*, Ode For Billie Dean*, NFA* > Who Do You Love* > Drums > Jam*, Come Back Baby*
Only ''Come Back Baby''; Only ''John's Other''; Only ''Ode To Billie Dean''; Only ''Uncle Sam Blues''; First ''Who Do You Love''; Next ''Who Do You Love'' 4/14/1972 [112 shows]
Also: NRPS. This run was originally scheduled to start on 11-26-70. *with Papa John Creach, Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Casady. "Good Lovin" includes a verse of "La Bamba" - only "John's Other" - only "Uncle Sam Blues" - only "Ode For Billie Dean."

Hard To Handle, Truckin, Minglewood, China Cat > I Know You Rider, Sugar Magnolia, Candyman, New Orleans, Cumberland, Brokedown, NFA
Next ''New Orleans'' 6/21/1984 [879 shows]
Also: NRPS. DeadBase�s long-running setlist of this show is from a tape that circulated in the 1970s but does not seem to be available now. It could well be from another show or combination of shows, but that is impossible to determine in the absence of this particular recording.


11/13/1970 46th Street Rock Palace, Brooklyn, NY
I: Casey Jones, Uncle John, Sugar Magnolia, Truckin
II: Dark Star > St. Stephen, NFA
Also: NRPS. DeadLists has the above songs according to an eyewitness. If accurate it is obviously fragmentary.

11/15/1970 Washington Avenue Armory, Albany, NY
The opening acts-Buddy Miles, and Pacific Gas & Electric-played as scheduled but the Dead left without performing due to two bomb threats.

E: Uncle John
Also: Hot Tuna; NRPS. *with Will Scarlet on harmonica +with Winwood, Capaldi, Wood and Ramblin' Jack Elliot. This recording long circulated as �Anderson Theater, 11-23-70,� but Greg Shaw and others have proven that this is in fact the 11-16-70 Fillmore East show. An audience tape of Good Lovin� with Jack Casady and Jorma Kaukonen sitting in, supposedly from this show, also exists but where it fits in the above sequence cannot be determined.


11/20/1970 The Palestra, U. of Rochester, Rochester, NY
I: Cold Rain, Me and My Uncle, Next Time, China Cat > I Know You Rider, Sugar Magnolia, FOTD, Mama Tried, Good Lovin > Drums > Good Lovin, Cumberland, Candyman, Truckin > Drums > Other One > St. Stephen > NFA > GDTRFB > NFA > King Bee, Casey Jones
II: All Over Now*, Jam*, Around*, Jam*, Darlin Corey* > Jam*, Jam*
E: Uncle John
Only ''Darlin Corey''; Next ''All Over Now'' 9/25/1976 [326 shows]
Also: NRPS. *with Jorma Kaukonen. Only "Darlin Corey." The set breaks might be different. "Uncle John�s Band" is probably the encore, but when dealing with choppy audience recordings such as this it can be hard to tell.


11/21/1970 Sargent Gym, Boston University, Boston, MA
Casey Jones, Candyman, Mama Tried, Easy Wind, Good Lovin > Good Lovin, Dancin, St. Stephen, Cryptical > Drums > Other One > Cryptical > Cosmic Charlie, Uncle John

11/27/1970 The Syndrome, Chicago, IL
I: Casey Jones, Sugar Magnolia, Brokedown, Uncle John
II: Lovelight
The show opened with "Casey Jones" and ended with "Lovelight," the rest of the order is incomplete and uncertain. DeadLists claims that NRPS opened, a jam leading into "Casey Jones" opened the Dead�s first set, and a "Truckin" into "The Other One" occurred in the Dead�s second set. No source for this is given.


11/29/1970 Club Agora, Columbus, OH

12/16/1970 The Matrix, San Francisco, CA
Drop Down Mama, Cowboy Movie, Triad, Wall Song, Bertha, Deep Elem, Motherless Children, Laughing
Billed as Jerry Garcia & Friends: David Crosby with Garcia, Lesh, and Hart. Soundcheck: Alabama Bound, Eight Miles High, Cowboy Movie, Wall Song, Bertha, Bird Song. The soundcheck had to have taken place no earlier than this date, since the band can be heard talking about what happened the night before. The live segment happened after the soundcheck, since Bertha sounds considerably more together. This is probably from the 16th but could have taken place the 17th, or the soundcheck could be from the 16th and the live segment from the 17th.


12/17/1970 The Matrix, San Francisco, CA
Billed as Jerry Garcia & Friends: David Crosby with Garcia, Lesh, and Hart.

"Benefit for the Montessori School and Bear." Billing: Hot Tuna; "Acoustic" Grateful Dead; NRPS; Lizard. The first five songs did not circulate for some years after the rest of the show became available, and were usually replaced with tunes from 10-4-70 and 10-5-70 that were part of a compilation tape made on this same date (they also circulate dated 12-17-70, which is not correct either). Not only that, the 05-15-70 early show has been known to circulate under this date.
