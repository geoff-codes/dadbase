<tr class="notes"><td>A flier exists for this show with Doug Sahm opening, which was subsequently cancelled. And it may be appropriate here to point out that some unknown but clever individual years ago made a compilation of first-set tunes from various 1973 shows and labeled it "Grateful Dead: Lima, Peru." Some fans who acquired this recording thought that this actually meant "Lima, Ohio," and attributed it to the October 1973 tour.  </i></td></tr>
