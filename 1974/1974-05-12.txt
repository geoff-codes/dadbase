I: Promised, Sugaree, Mexicali, Tennessee Jed, Jack Straw, B. E. Women, BIODTL, China Cat > I Know You Rider, El Paso, U.S. Blues, Greatest, Roses, Bobby McGee, Deal, Around
II: Half Step, Truckin > Nobody�s Jam > Other One > Mind Left Body Jam > Row Jimmy, Big River, Ship of Fools, Sugar Magnolia
"Beer Barrel Polka" tuning before "Tennessee Jed." - 7-beat "BIODTL." Set breaks cannot be determined from the circulating tapes, but the most likely spot for one is between "Around and Around" and "Half Step" -definitely not between "Half Step" and "Truckin". In addition, the band blew up a good part of the PA early on and likely took an equipment break somewhere in the first set, which could explain why some in attendance described this as a �three-set show.�
