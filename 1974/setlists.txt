"The Sound Test" for The Wall Of Sound. *appears on "Dick�s Picks Volume 24." False start on "Playing in the Band" due to non-working vocal mic. "Casey Jones" most definitely ends the second set and is not an encore.

"Beer Barrel Polka" tuning before "Tennessee Jed." - 7-beat "BIODTL." Set breaks cannot be determined from the circulating tapes, but the most likely spot for one is between "Around and Around" and "Half Step" -definitely not between "Half Step" and "Truckin". In addition, the band blew up a good part of the PA early on and likely took an equipment break somewhere in the first set, which could explain why some in attendance described this as a �three-set show.�
