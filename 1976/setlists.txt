6/30/1976 Syria Mosque, Pittsburgh, PA
These shows were cancelled reportedly so the Dead could play Roosevelt Stadium, which they did not do until August 4. When the Pittsburgh shows were blown off June 29 was added to the Chicago run. In addition, the Dead originally had planned five nights at Winterland in early June before the tour began, which were cancelled and the two nights in Portland added at the last minute. Besides all that, rumors circulated at this time of the Dead playing a free show in San Francisco, either in Union Square or Golden Gate Park. This was supposed to have taken place anytime from early June until right before the Orpheum run, but most commonly predicted for the Bicentennial on the 4th of July.
