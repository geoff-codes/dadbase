Dead roadie Steve Parish, in his book "Home Before Daylight," cites this as the show where Garcia gobbled four valiums before taking the stage. A gentleman named Tom F. on the Internet Archive claims to have gotten a soundboard master of the first set of this performance two nights later in Kansas City, which is the supposed source of the recording from which the above list originates. Garcia certainly sounds like he is progressively losing it during the set, so it might have made sense for the band to veer into a drum break to give him a chance to straighten up (and he does sound somewhat more together afterwards). What, if anything, happened after "Bertha" (which ends the set and does not segue into "Good Lovin") is unknown. Unfortunately, there are cuts on the recording between "Stagger Lee" and "Dancin," and between "Drumz" and "I Need a Miracle," meaning that there is no conclusive proof that "Dancin" into "Drumz" took place in the opening set and not later.
