Show originally scheduled for 05-07-81. *for Bobby Sands. Regarding the jam out of "He's Gone": The first part does not develop into a full-fledged "Caution"; the second part, while displaying a Spanish flavor, bears no relation to Miles Davisï¿½ "Solea." Entire show appears on "Dick's Picks Vol 13."
