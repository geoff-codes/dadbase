Next ''Big Boss Man'' 12/31/1983 [131 shows]
Soundcheck: "Big Boss Man," "Cumberland." "A Day At The Dentist" during Drumz." Since there appears to be some controversy over the status of the "Eleven Jam," we will here point out that DeadBase author Mike Dolgushkin attended this show, was situated very close to the stage, and saw Mickey turn to Phil and say �The Eleven�, after which Phil nodded eagerly and the band began playing it.
