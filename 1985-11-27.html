              All members of the Grateful Dead were present at the Fillmore for Bill Graham's 20th anniversary party and equipment was brought for a set, but the band did not perform. One explanation making the rounds afterward claimed that the Dead wanted to play at 10PM but Graham had planned for them to close the evening.
