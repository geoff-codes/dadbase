6/8/1985 Cal Expo Amphitheatre, Sacramento, CA
These shows were cancelled so that Lesh, Garcia, and Weir could attend performances of Wagner's "Ring of the Nibelung" in San Francisco. This gave rise to rumors that the Cal Expo shows were actually scraped so that the Dead could play a 20th anniversary free concert either in Golden Gate Park or at the Haight Street Fair. This did not occur, but free show rumors persisted through September.
