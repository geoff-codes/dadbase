Sunday, August 20, 1989

8/20/1989 Greek Theatre, U. of California, Berkeley, CA
The 1989 Greek shows were originally scheduled for the usual Friday through Sunday of August 18, 19 & 20, but were almost cancelled outright because the UC Berkeley administration did not want the Grateful Dead playing on oreintation day. The powers-that-be finally relented and allowed the shows to be moved back one day.
